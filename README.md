# double-moon-classification-problem
Solution for the Double Moon Classification Problem with deep neural networks (NumPy and Matplotlib only).

The Double Moon Classification Problem was first introduced in section 1.5 of Simon Haykin's Neural Networks and Learning Machines. It consists in correctly classify any given pair (x, y) between to different classes displayed as half moons in the cartesian plane. The following picture, taken from Haykin's book, illustrate the two different classes from the problem.
